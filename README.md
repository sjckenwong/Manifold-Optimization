# Optimization algorithms on affine Grassmannian and Flag manifold

This respository contains the codes to perform steepest descent and conjugate gradient algorithms on:
  - affine Grassmannian: set of k-dimensional affine subspaces in $\mathbb{R}^n$
  - flag manifold:$ all nested sequences of linear subspaces in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with dimensions $n_1 < \cdots < n_d$
