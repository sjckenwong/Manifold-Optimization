# Optimization algorithms on affine Grassmannian and Flag manifold

This respository contains the codes to perform steepest descent and conjugate gradient algorithms on:
  - affine Grassmannian: set of k-dimensional affine subspaces
  - flag manifold: all nested sequences of linear subspaces
  
Examples of statistical estimation problems that can be solved by above algorithsm include: lienar regression, principal component analysis, canonical correlation analysis, and dominant invariant subspace.
